    "even if it were possible to form a perfect estimate for f, so that our estimated response took the form $\\hat Y = f(X)$, our prediction would still have some error in it since Y is also a function $\\epsilon$ which, by definition, cannot be predicted using X. This error can resulted from many factors such as error in measuring instruments used in collecting the data. Therefore, variability associated with $\\epsilon$ also affects the accuracy of our predictions. This is known as the irreducible error, because even with a good statistical learning technique $\\hat f$ used to estimate f we cannot reduce the error introduced by $\\epsilon$"
